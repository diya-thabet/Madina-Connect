--- 1. FULL RESET (Delete & Restart) ---

Run this to delete all old pods/services and start fresh.

kubectl delete -f madina-complete.yaml
kubectl apply -f madina-complete.yaml

--- 2. CHECK STATUS ---

Watch the pods until they are all "Running" and "1/1"

kubectl get pods -w

--- 3. EXPOSE PORTS (Required for Kind/Linux) ---

Once pods are running, run these to access them on localhost.

The '&' runs them in the background so you can keep using the terminal.
